<h1> Introduction </h1>

<p> The dataset we'll be using for this project contains information on various power outages throughout the United States. Through examining this dataset, we hope to answer the question, "What factors cause more or less customers to be affected by power outages?" By identifying what factors cause power outages to have the most far-reaching effects, we hope to gain new insights as to how to prevent these outages in the future. </p> <br>
<p> In order to perform a holistic analysis, we ought to examine as many potentially relevant columns as possible. In particular, we will be considering the following columns - ['YEAR', 'MONTH', 'U.S._STATE', 'ANOMALY.LEVEL', 'CLIMATE.CATEGORY', 'OUTAGE.START.DATE', 'OUTAGE.START.TIME', 'OUTAGE.RESTORATION.DATE', 'OUTAGE.RESTORATION.TIME', 'CAUSE.CATEGORY', 'CAUSE.CATEGORY.DETAIL', 'HURRICANE.NAMES', 'OUTAGE.DURATION', 'CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED', 'TOTAL.PRICE', 'TOTAL.SALES'] </p>
<a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918307182> Descriptions of these columns, as well as those included in the original dataset but ommitted from this analysis, can be found here. </a>
